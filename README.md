# Templates for Machine Learning and Computer Vision Projects

This week-long program introduces a number of projects related to computer vision and machine learning using Python and JavaScript. 

This repository will be updated as week progresses.

Inital setup is

```
pipenv install
```

This will install all requirements for the projects in a new Python virtual environment.

Then activate the virtual environment with

```
pipenv shell
```

## Installation on a new computer
